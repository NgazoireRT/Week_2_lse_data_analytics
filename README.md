**Module 2: Data ingestion with Pandas!**

Python is more developmentally flexible than most programming languages used for data manipulation and analysis. This is, at least in part, due to the wide range of libraries available. 
You briefly learned about libraries in Module 1 of this course. Python libraries support a variety of data analytics tasks, from scraping the web to data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation. 
One of the most widely used libraries is Pandas because it provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

In this module, you'll learn about the most sought-after Python library, Pandas, and its data structures, its Series, and the DataFrame. 
You will get a chance to write small code snippets, generate random data, and test various functions and methods in Jupyter Notebook. 
Some of the concepts and methods you will learn in this module will be explored individually in order to build the necessary foundations of Pandas. 
Later on, you'll learn how to form an end-to-end use case.

****Learning outcomes***

Throughout the module, you'll learn to:

*import CSV files and wrangle data using Python operations
*use Pandas operations such as reindexing, mapping, and sorting to explore and analyse data
*create fundamental Pandas data structures (Series and DataFrame)
*use Jupyter Notebook to perform Python operations and create a shareable interactive workbook
*perform statistical computations such as mean, sum, and cumulative sum by writing code using Pandas functions and methods.
